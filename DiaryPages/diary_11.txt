	I finally reached it... I finally reached The Dragon's hideout. Turns out
he was hiding in an abandoned castle. I can't believe I will actually be the one
who is going to slay The Dragon and be written in as The Dragonslayer in
history books. I have something to confess though. I now realise the true purpose
of this diary. I didn't write it so that it can be historical evidence for the
event that's about to happen. No. I wrote because it was the only thing that kept
me from losing my mind. Without this diary I think I would have lost all my
ambition and I would have lost my way. I know this because I met people to whom
that had happened, on my way here. They were either completely insane or had
lost all motivation to keep on going. So thank you. Thank you diary and thank you
for reading this.
	Oh, one last thing... I never actually wrote my name. Wouldn't want The Dragonslayer
to be left nameless now would we. Well, here it is... Drogan. Drogan's my name. 
I hope it's a name you'll never forget.
