	Just in case you have another system for keeping track of time
I'll explain how our's works. This current system is based around
The Dragon. When it came one of the villagers counted how many days
it stayed. He was called Acic Lovir. The Dragon left after 300 days. 
For some reason Acic continued counting even after The Dragon had left. 
When it came again 600 days had passed since it's first arrival.
And again it left 300 days after it arrived. Acic saw that there was
a pattern. He continued counting the days until he died. But before
he died he was able to tell one person his discovery.
