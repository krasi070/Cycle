	I now realise that I haven't explained what's the story behind 
this diary. It's purpose is to be found by someone in the future and be
used for historic evidence of the events from this time period. So in order 
for you, the reader, to be able understand this better I guess I should 
start from the beginning.
	My village called Varda isn't that big but that wasn't always the case. 
Before The Dragon appeared my village was huge. That's what I've been told 
by my elders. When The Dragon came it destroyed everything my ancestors had. 
After it left the survivors thought that the nightmare was over and that after 
some time passed everything would be back to normal. But that never came to be.
