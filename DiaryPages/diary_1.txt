27-EARTH-CYCLE 137
	One thing I have noticed is the amount of bones covering the ground.
I feel bad for these dead soldiers. If my knowledge serves me right
these bones belong to the Fifth Great Army. I don't really know what made them 
so "Great" though... they were annihilated by The Dragon's minions just ten days after 
leaving Varda. They were probably called that so that our people didn't lose hope.
	What's funny is that I left Varda 12 days ago and I'm still as good as new.
Which makes me wonder... what could they have possibly encounterd on their way
to The Dragon. I bumped into a few monsters on my journey but nothing so tough to be 
able to defeat a 343-man-army. Were they ambushed? I don't think I'll ever find out
what happened and to be honest I'm glad that I won't.
