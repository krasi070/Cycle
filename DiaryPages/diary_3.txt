60-EARTH-CYCLE 137
	I've been out here for what seems like a whole cycle but it's actually
only been 45 days. I'm starting to get tired from all this. Fighting one monster
after another. Honestly if it hadn't been for that shopkeeper I'd probably be
dead by now. I'm not seeing that many dead bodies anymore. I must have reached
farther than the Sixth Great Army (the last one) by now. Which at the same
time makes me happy and terrified.
