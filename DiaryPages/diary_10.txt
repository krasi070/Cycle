44-WATER-CYCLE 137
	Today I realised something. It's not because I'm strong or because
I'm smart that I was able to survive for so long. It was all because of the
shopkeeper.
	He was the one who showed me how magic robbers worked and he was the
one who gave them to me for nothing in return. Not only that but he always
seems to be exactly where I am and when I need him the most, even though
I can never sense him following me. One minute I say goodbye to him and
the next he has already set his shop at the place where I'm headed.
	I'm starting to wonder if The Dragon is the one I should be worried about.
