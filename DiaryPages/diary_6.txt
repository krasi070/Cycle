120-EARTH-CYCLE 137
	Over 100 days have passed since I left Varda. I wonder how everyone's
doing. The good thing is that I have gotten use to this kind of life.
Fighting all these monsters has made me a lot stronger. I finally believe
that I might stand a chance against The Dragon.
	One detail that I forgot to tell you is that when I finally reach The
Dragon it won't really put much of a fight. You know why? Because it'll be
sleeping. That's the reason why I'm going to it and not just waiting for
it to arrive at Varda's gates again. Acic didn't only count days. He also
had theories why The Dragon leaves after 300 days. His theory was that in order
for The Dragon to be so powerful he must sleep for hundreds of days. And since
nobody has seen him sleep while he's in Varda, Acic says that when it leaves
it goes searching for a place where to sleep for 300 days.
	Nobody has ever stood a chance against The Dragon while it's awake. Even
whole armies have been destroyed by it in minutes. That's how the first four
Great Armies were defeated. The next two Great Armies decided to go with Acic's
theory and decied to slay The Dragon while it was sleeping. Of course, as I told
you they didn't even find The Dragon. But my fate won't be the same as theirs.
