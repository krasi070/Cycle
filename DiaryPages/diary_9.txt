1-WATER-CYCLE 137
	Today starts the Water period. Unsurprisingly, this is everyone's favourite
time of the cycle. But after the fifthieth Water day everyone starts 
realising that The Dragon will be coming soon.
	You'd think that after 137 cycles we would be used to getting attacked
by The Dragon. We do what we can. For these 137 cycles we have dug some underground
tunnels where the women and the children can hide during the Fire period.
Sadly, they aren't that big so only about half of the villagers can hide there.
Not only that, but one cycle one of the tunnels collapsed and everyone in it 
were found dead. 
	Well, on the bright side of things every first Water day a festival is held.
That's the only official festival we have at Varda. I just hope I get back alive
and be able to participate in the festivals competitions next cycle like I
always do.
