	I'm running out of time. I've got only about 100 days before The Dragon
wakes up and takes flight yet again. If that happens I'll die. Not from The
Dragon but from its minions. These monsters have been around for as long as
us villagers according to the books. But when The Dragon came it brought them
too. They had become its minions. The thing is that while The Dragon's asleep
they aren't a real threat to us and the reason for that is because there is
nobody to protect them and nobody to unite them. Monsters aren't good at making
friends. That's why when there is a monster attack in Varda it isn't a problem
because there's only one monster. Don't get me wrong. If we were to compare who was
stronger, a monster or a villager, a monster would definetely be the right answer.
But since only one monster comes at a time and there are a lot of soldiers 
defending Varda, keeping ourselves safe from monsters wasn't hard.
	But The Dragon somehow has the power to make the monsters forget their
differences and unite. But that's only when it is awake. Now you see
that I not only have the opportunity to slay The Dragon while it's sleeping but
also that all the monsters are by themselves and are pretty easy for someone 
like me to handle. But if it wakes up before I reach it, the mosters will surround
me and they'll have the numbers advantage. I have to hurry.
