87-EARTH-CYCLE 137
	Acic had found a pattern. He said that when The Dragon comes
it stays for 300 days. Then follow 200 days of drought since The Dragon
not only destroys everything in its path but it also drinks every last bit
of water it finds. And lastly follow 100 days of rain. Acic had names for
each of these periods and he called the three of them together a cycle since
they always seemed to repeat that pattern. The period when The Dragon 
comes is called Fire and that's when a cycle begins. The 200 days of drought 
are called Earth. And the 100 days of rain are called Water.
	Now that you understand how we keep track of time you can see that at the
time of me writing it is currently the 137th cycle. And you have probably
realised that The Dragon has been alive for over 137 cycles. That's about
3 or 4 of my peoples life time. And this is the reason why I am on this
journey. We have waited far too long for The Dragon to die on its own. None
of armies even reached it. I have decided to take things into my own hands.
I'll be the one who will defeat The Dragon and bring an end to his tyranny.
